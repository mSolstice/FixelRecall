# Fixel Recall

Operate the local Fixel Recall engine for Codex and Claude Code.

## Rules

- This skill operates a local engine and gateway for future provider requests.
- It cannot compress or transform the request already invoking this skill.
- Safe mode is the default.
- Exact, current, action-critical and secret-sensitive material stays protected.
- Benchmark results may be positive, neutral or negative.
- Never request, print or store provider credentials.

## Workflow

1. Classify the task: audit, reduce, diagnose, start, stop, explain, benchmark, retrieve or setup.
2. Read only the relevant reference below.
3. Prefer local CLI commands and deterministic repository scripts.
4. Preserve safety boundaries; do not weaken policy rules for savings.
5. Report measured versus estimated results and any blocked action.
